# Too Much of Everything 2
TMOE 2 Modpack Repo.

What is Too Much of Everything 2?
Simply put, TMOE2 is the spirtual successor of Too Much of Everything. This was a modpack created back in 2018 on ATLauncher. The idea was to create a large scale modpack, which is community driven, without the limitation of custom recipes, quests locking you out of your favourite mods, or recipes being disabled for being too "over powered". We wanted to create a modpack that you could just enjoy, which had literally every mod you could think of. If the mod wasn't already in the pack, we allowed the community to request mods to be added, and a quick reason why they wanted it. Typically, if possible, we would include that mod(s) in the next large update.
This modpack features every large mod for 1.20.1, with the exceptions of overlapping mods. We tried to choose the most popular and more compatible mods for every feature, such as mini maps, chunk loading, etc.
What makes this modpack different from other modpacks of similar size?
For starters, TMOE 2 doesn't limit you. Your imagination is your only limit. We have not locked anything behind custom recipes, unlocking certain quests, an order of progression, etc. We let you decide how you want to play, and we just provide the content.

Why should I pick this modpack over some of the better known packs?
Simply, we believe you should pick whatever modpack you want to play. This is a simple pack, with over 430 mods included, with as much integration between the mods as we could possibly find. If you don't want to deal with quests and arbitrary locked recipes, then TMOE 2 might be the modpack for you.

When will you update the pack or add "x" mod?
We will update the pack regularily as we find bugs, updates for mods, and to add content requested by the community, or that we feel should be included in the pack. 

Will you ever add a quest system?
Maybe. We aren't against quests, but we are against locking players out until they complete a certain quest before being able to move forward in a mod. If we add quests, they will be simply to assist you in progression of mods, and to provide fun rewards for completing a task or progressing further into a mod.

Why did you choose "x" mod over "x" mod?
We tried to choose the most popular option out of 2 mods that may compete. It's not easy to have 2 of the same mods in the pack, and keep everything working without conflict. We also didn't want to force players to manually choose exactly which mod they want to use, and not break their game. We believe it is simpliar to pick one, and make changes in the future based on community comments.
